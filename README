Disclaimer
==========
Please read the LICENSE file carefully.

This Ruby binding for OpenAMQ is still under continuous development. It is
being used in production environment. However, the higher-level ruby interface
in lib/amq/openamq.rb is still evolving. It is not very Ruby'ish yet. The
RWire module is just a thin wrapper around the WireAPI, which is relatively
stable. i.e., it's unlikely to change going forward. I can't guarantee that
the Ruby abstraction layer will be backward compatible as it's still evolving.
Use at your own risk.

Platforms
=========

Tested only on Mac OS X 10.5.6 and Linux Ubuntu. Other platforms have not been
tested.

Example
=======

require 'amq/openamq'

# Create an OpenAMQ connection
AMQ::Connection.connect() do |c|
  # Create an OpenAMQ Session
  c.new_session() do |s|
    # Publish a request message 'Hello' using foobar is the routing key.
    # And listen for response back.  The AMQP content body is returned.
    puts s.request(:body => "Hello", :routing_key => "foobar")
  end
end
